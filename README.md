# Tardis Peripherals

Welcome to the repo. This is a multi-loader mod, made for use with either forge or fabric, in order to be compatible with both versions of Tardis Refined.

This repo also plans to be compatible with 'New Tardis Mod', once it has finished porting to newer versions of minecraft.

### How to use the repo:
Fork and/or clone a copy of the repo to your computer.

Load up the project in Intellij Idea (community edition available for free).

Ensure you've installed java 17, as this minecraft version requires newer versions of java.

Let the project finish importing, it will automatically download all required dependencies and generate run configurations.
